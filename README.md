# Crypto development resources

This document pretends to be a comprehensive (and of course constantly updated and outdated) compilation of many sources I have been using since I started in crypto in 2016. Most of the content is in English🇬🇧, but since we wanted to share the knowledge with the audience that comes from Latin America, we have collected some resources in Spanish🇪🇸 as well.
We followed the awesome [DeFi Developer Roadmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffcierCia/DeFi-Developer-Road-Map/main/DeFiRoadMapNewSVG.svg) by `Cia_Officer` as the main guidance for completing this work.\
Feel free to share, make contributions, deletions and critics to this document, we are all here to learn and build!

## How to start and not to fail

Every time you want to read something, ten brand new (and interesting) resources appear. Blockchain universe evolves at 100x speed light, and that causes an enormous anxiety… So, how can you learn faster or at least you can feel a real progress?

Perhaps something like the `get things done` method might help:

```
- You want to learn, and don't know where to start.
- Take 15 mins in the morning.
- On a whiteboard or just a notepad,
- Write it all down on a list, everything you want to learn.
- Use those 15 mins to sort the items.
- Mark them as critical, important, can wait, irrelevant.
- Now: stick to the list.
- Complete each task.

The morning after, repeat the process.
```
